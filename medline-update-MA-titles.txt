Supine Versus Prone Position in Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy for Kidney Calculi:
A Meta-Analysis

8800
BACKGROUND: There are several positions in the operation of percutaneou
nephrolithotomy (PCNL), such as prone position, supine position, flank position,
and modified supine position for PCNL, but the supine and prone positions are th
main two choices for several years. However, there is still discrepancy on th
optimal position for PCNL. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to evaluat
safety and efficacy of the supine versus the prone position in PCNL for rena
calculi
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane database libraries to loo
for relevant studies. All eligible controlled trials comparing supine versu
prone positions for treating renal calculi were included in the meta-analysis
The main outcome of efficacy (stone-free rate, mean operative time, an
hospitalization time) and safety (complication, blood transfusions) were assesse
by using Review Manager 4.2 software. We calculated the estimate of effec
associated with the two positions according to the heterogeneity usin
random-effects or fixed-effects models
RESULTS: Thirteen studies (six randomized controlled trials and seve
retrospective studies) with a total of 6881 patients contributed to thi
meta-analysis. The meta-analysis indicated/suggested that PCNL in the pron
position was associated with a higher rate of stone clearance than PCNL in th
supine position (odds ratio [OR]: 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65, 0.84
p < 0.00001). A shorter mean operative time was observed in the supine group
(weighted mean difference [WMD]: -18.27; 95% CI: -35.77, -0.77; p = 0.04)
Compared with the prone position, there was also a lower incidence of bloo
transfusions in the supine groups (WMD: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.95; p = 0.02). N
difference was observed between the positions with regard to the hospital sta
(WMD: -0.14; 95% CI: -0.76, 0.47; p = 0.65) and complications (OR: 0.88; 95% CI:
0.76, 1.02; p = 0.10)
CONCLUSION: Compared with the prone position, the PCNL in the supine position ha
a slightly lower rate of stone clearance, albeit shorter mean operative time, an
lower incidence of blood transfusions. The meta-analysis suggests that the PCN
in the supine position is a promising alternative
