1. how many meta-analyses in biomedical topics have used Bayesian methods?
2. how reproducible are the meta-analyses:
2a. is code provided?
2b. are data provided?
2c. is the software version named? What software was used, and is it open-source?
3. what "ancestors" [Arksey & O'Malley] are cited for Bayesian MA?
4. what problems is it used for?
5. do the authors report it as successful?
6. what sort of model is employed?
7. what sort of priors are employed?
8a. did they use both frequentist and Bayesian versions of the same analysis?
8b. if so, do they justify this?
9. which specialisms and/or disease areas have made use of Bayes MA?
